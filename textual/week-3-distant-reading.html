            <img src="project1.jpg" alt="Project 1 Image" class="project-detail-image">
            <p>This project explores the intersection of generative AI and literary analysis through three distinct experiments using classic works of fiction. Drawing on Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island and H.G. Wells's War of the Worlds, The Time Machine, and The World Set Free, these exercises showcase how AI tools like ChatGPT can facilitate—and sometimes challenge—distant reading practices.</p>

            <p>The first experiment focused on Treasure Island and included processing the text for word frequency analysis, generating a word cloud, and prompting the AI to create a pirate-themed visualization. While the data processing was seamless and used familiar Python libraries (e.g., NLTK and Matplotlib), the attempt at thematic visualization exposed the limitations of AI's creativity when the tool shifted to DALL-E. The result was visually amusing but practically unusable.</p>
                
            <p>The second experiment expanded into a comparative analysis of the H.G. Wells novels. By examining metrics such as sentence length over time, the experiment underscored the ease with which ChatGPT can surface insights, even if some findings—like unusually long sentences—prompted more curiosity than conclusions. The exercise demonstrated how AI can lower the barrier to conducting exploratory analyses, inviting deeper dives into patterns across larger corpora.</p>
                
            <p>Finally, the third experiment involved authorship analysis using pre-processed, anonymized texts. By focusing on function word frequencies, ChatGPT provided percentages that hinted at stylistic markers across the novels. While inconclusive, the results opened pathways for further stylometric research, particularly with comparison to larger corpora like Project Gutenberg. Across these experiments, the dual nature of AI as both a transparent and opaque tool emerged: while code-based outputs provided clarity, creative or symbolic tasks revealed limitations.<p>
                
            <p>This project reflects on the potential of generative AI to serve as both a partner in computational analysis and a lens through which to examine the evolving methodologies of distant reading. It also highlights how these tools, while powerful, still leave gaps in transparency—an enduring challenge in machine learning applications to the humanities.</p>
