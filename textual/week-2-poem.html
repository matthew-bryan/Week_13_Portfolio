            <img src="..assets/week-2-poem-image.jpg" alt="Robotic hand writing on a scroll with a glowing feather pen, surrounded by neural network patterns and illuminated text, evoking themes of AI and poetry." class="project-detail-image">
        
            <p>This project is an exploration of how artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT, can attempt to recreate and critique the poetic qualities of James Wright's later work. The poem "A Hard Truth in the Quiet" is the result of a series of prompts, which ranged from generating poems inspired by Wright to transforming analytical explanations into poetry. The process involved using multiple iterations of the AI model, from GPT-4 to GPT-4 mini, as the conversation progressed. The aim was not just to mimic Wright's poetic form but to delve into the reasoning behind each generated poem—examining how the AI justified its creative decisions in relation to Wright’s work.</p>

            <p>One of the main ideas behind this experiment was to see if the "interface" of AI—normally hidden—could be coaxed into revealing itself by explaining its choices. Unfortunately, while the poems produced were often accurate imitations of Wright's style, the explanations were less enlightening than hoped. Instead of shedding light on how the model's knowledge was sourced or balanced, the process only underlined the limitations of accessing AI's internal workings. Additionally, reflecting on my personal connection to poetry, the exercise raised questions about authenticity and materiality. The absence of a curated, tangible volume to hold these AI-generated poems influenced my perception of their quality—prompting reflections on the role of context and authority in poetic appreciation.</p>
            <p>Here's the poem:</p>
            <h1>A Hard Truth in the Quiet</h1>
            <p>In the dimness of my study,<br>
            I read your poem, "In the Quiet Spaces,"<br>
            And I see the fog settling<br>
            Over what you meant to say.<br>
            Your words drift like mist,<br>
            Soft, abstract,<br>
            But they leave me grasping<br>
            For something more.</p>
    
            <p>I remember the deer at dusk,<br>
            Its eyes clear in the edge of the forest—<br>
            A moment caught,<br>
            Concrete and sharp,<br>
            Where the free verse<br>
            Holds meaning like a living thing.<br>
            There is no fog here,<br>
            No veiled impressions,<br>
            Just the straightforward grace<br>
            Of what is seen and felt.</p>
            
            <p>In your hands, the themes are ghostly,<br>
            Whispers of what James Wright means,<br>
            Lost in the murmurs of the river.<br>
            But "A Study of the Light"<br>
            Shows me the way,<br>
            Illuminates the path<br>
            Through his world of fleeting moments.<br>
            The imagery cuts through the haze,<br>
            Every line a clear reflection,<br>
            Every image a touchstone.</p>
            
            <p>I see the deer, the snow, the rain,<br>
            Held in the hands of a poet<br>
            Who doesn’t shy from clarity.<br>
            The beauty of those moments<br>
            Is not lost in abstraction,<br>
            But laid bare,<br>
            For the eyes and heart<br>
            To truly see.</p>
            
            <p>The quiet spaces may comfort,<br>
            But they do not challenge,<br>
            Do not reveal<br>
            The raw edge of Wright’s world.<br>
            There is more in the details,<br>
            In the specific,<br>
            In the sharpness of experience—<br>
            A study of the light<br>
            Is the truer reflection<br>
            Of his profound simplicity.</p>
            
            <p>So, as I read through your work,<br>
            I hope you understand the truth:<br>
            In the clear lines,<br>
            In the vivid imagery,<br>
            Lies the power of Wright’s voice.<br>
            In the quiet spaces,<br>
            We drift away,<br>
            Lost in what could be,<br>
            Missing the brilliance<br>
            Of what is.</p>
