            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <img src="project1.jpg" alt="Project 1 Image" class="project-detail-image">
            <p>This project is a single-screen, point-and-click adventure game inspired by 1990s classics like Metal Slug and Lucasarts games. In U.F.O., players take on the role of an alien agent tasked with evaluating Earth’s humanity. Through a mix of EXAMINE and INTERACT commands, players navigate a chaotic scene to determine if Earthlings are worthy of empathy—or simply practice for invasion. The game features multiple endings determined by a ""favorability"" score, blending humor with light moral judgment.</p>

                <p>The project began with no clear narrative in mind but evolved through iterative collaboration with ChatGPT and DALL-E. Initial concepts were built around pixel-art-inspired background images, with prompts aimed at creating a late-90s aesthetic. One serendipitous miscommunication in the generation process sparked the game’s narrative direction: an unexpected image of an alien restrained in a chair inspired both the story and interactive gameplay elements.</p>
                
                    <p>The EXAMINE system highlights ChatGPT's strengths in text generation. For each interactive object, multiple descriptions were created, then coded to display randomly. This feature ensures a dynamic experience, making the game world feel more alive. Using ChatGPT's code review features also led to refactoring improvements, better modularity, and a more legible UI. While the process wasn’t without its challenges—particularly with GitHub branches, debugging, and ChatGPT’s occasional overwriting of tailored content—the iterative nature of generative AI enabled rapid experimentation and creative problem-solving.</p>
                
                        <p>At its core, U.F.O. celebrates the blend of human creativity and AI assistance, reflecting on how classic genres can inspire new, hybrid forms of storytelling. The game’s playful tone and adaptive design showcase the potential of generative tools in creating interactive, engaging experiences.</p>
